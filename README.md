# 🧠 JavaScript Core Concepts — Practice Repository

This repository contains simple and clear code examples demonstrating **15 essential JavaScript concepts** — from the fundamentals of scope and hoisting to modern ES6+ features and asynchronous programming.

Each concept is explained using small, practical code snippets and real examples.

## 📘 Contents

### 🧩 Core JavaScript Foundations
1. **Execution Context & Scope**  
   → Demonstrates how JavaScript executes code and handles global, function, and block scopes.

2. **Hoisting & Variable Declarations**  
   → Shows how `var`, `let`, and `const` behave differently when hoisted.

3. **Closures**  
   → Explains how inner functions access variables from outer scopes.

4. **This Keyword & Binding**  
   → Examples of `this` in normal functions, arrow functions, and class contexts.

5. **Prototype & Inheritance**  
   → Demonstrates how JavaScript objects inherit methods using prototypes.

---

### ⚙️ Asynchronous JavaScript
6. **Promises & Async/Await**  
   → Shows how promises work and how `async/await` makes async code cleaner.

7. **Event Loop & Task Queue**  
   → Explains execution order of synchronous, microtasks, and macrotasks.

8. **Fetch API & AJAX**  
   → Demonstrates making HTTP requests and handling responses.

### 🌈 Modern ES6+ Features
9. **Destructuring & Spread/Rest Operators**  
   → Examples of simplifying arrays and objects.

10. **Modules (import/export)**  
    → Explains modular JS using ES Modules and browser setup (`type="module"`).

11. **Arrow Functions & Default Parameters**  
    → Shows cleaner syntax and default argument values.

12. **Optional Chaining & Nullish Coalescing (`?.`, `??`)**  
    → Safe property access without runtime errors.

---

### 💡 Advanced & Useful Concepts
13. **Event Delegation & DOM Manipulation**  
    → Dynamically creates elements and efficiently handles events with delegation.

14. **Functional Programming Patterns**  
    → Examples using `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, pure functions, and immutability.

15. **Error Handling**  
    → Covers `try...catch`, custom error messages, and async error handling.

## 🧰 How to Run

1. Open the folder in **VS Code**.  
2. Install the **Live Server** extension (if not already).  
3. Right-click any `.html` file → **"Open with Live Server"**.  
4. View results in the browser console (developer tools).
5. Make sure to change the concet number each time in html file to run the new concept.
